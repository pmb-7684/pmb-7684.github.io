**Wow…**

We are coming to the end.  The semester just like the year has flown by.  This was a great course.    

As I reflect on best practices, I will make it a point to look for simpler solutions.  More times than not I begin with the most difficult 
solution to the problem.  Not sure why but it’s been known to happen.  This can lead to frustration on my part and wasted time. I also plan 
to sketch out the code for projects (especially with shiny apps) to stay focused on the results.

I plan to be a data scientist in a financial institution or insurance company. Initially, I’m looking for a more structured organization so I can gain 
experience and have support from more senior associates.  Ultimately, I would like to work for Google or Amazon. Yes, I’m thinking big…. 

During the upcoming months, I plan to read more to fully understand the relationship between data science and statistics. This course has helped me solidify 
that there is a big distinction between the two.  The scope of statistics in data science seems sadly limited to intro stuff – measures of center, visualization,
etc.  Statistician don’t use many (if any) of the algorithms commonly used in the data science field.  Honestly, I still don’t see how hypothesis testing fits 
into data science. I understand the testing concept. There are millions of observations.  Are we sampling to determine if there is evidence to support or not? 
Same concept on a larger scale? When it comes to sampling “big data” at what point is your sample too large?   Another concept that seems foreign to data science
is simulations.  If you have access to millions of observations, why do you need to simulate any data?    Why couldn’t you just run the algorithm on another 
sample *(group not tested before)* from the group?  *(I saw simulations on a posting for position over the summer)*

Finally, I plan to continue working on my MS in statistics and look for alternatives for my next career path as a business analyst, data engineer, etc. 
Honestly, I am not confident that most employers are looking for stats or even math majors – even if you have a masters or PhD to fill roles in the data science
industry.  When you look at many of those openings, it’s focused on hardcore computer programmers – python, pySpark, Hadoop, experience with big data 
*(now I’ve seen a local postings for a data analyst asking for experience with millions of gigabytes)*, SQL, etc.  

Hmm…this entry sounds kind of sad.  It’s not. Life would be boring if you didn’t have change and learn to adapt.

Have a great winter break!
