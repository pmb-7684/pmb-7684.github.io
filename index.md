Hello World !!

The main purpose of this blog is to document my journey to finding a new career in this data driven world.   As crazy as it seems this is my third career change.  I've spent years in middle management in customer service and later years as an actuarial analyst at an insurance company. This webpage will be a way to provide tips and tools I've learned along the way and to document by projects. 

I started this webpage several years ago while attending another university.  So, rather than starting from scratch and loosing projects I worked on in the past, I plan to refresh the page and
built it into a skill driven portfolio.

About Me:

Currently, I am a senior majoring in Data Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am excited to say that I will be graduating in May 2025.  When I'm not working and attending college full-time, I am the secretary for the Eta Xi Chapter of Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity. 

I don't like cold weather, but I like this winter scene and the journey it depicts to me.
Life is a journey.  You have to keep moving forward and don't look back.
