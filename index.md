Hello World!! 

The main process of this blog is to notate my journey to finding a new career in this data driven world.   As crazy as it seems this is my third career change.  I've spent years in middle managment in customer service and later years as an actuarial analyst. Mainly, this will be a way to provide tips and tools I've learned along the way.

Beside this journey, I may post about my hobbies - cooking and the many projects around my home :house_with_garden:

Have a great day!!!
