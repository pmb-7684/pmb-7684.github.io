Hello World !!

The main purpose of this blog is to document my journey to finding a new career in this data driven world.   As crazy as it seems this is my third career change.  I've spent years in middle management in customer service and later years as an actuarial analyst. This will be a way to provide tips and tools I've learned along the way. 

I started this webpage several years ago while attending another university.  So, rather than starting from scratch, I plan to update this page.
